    "**What you will accomplish in this chapter:**  \n",
    " You will install PraisonAI agents framework and all necessary Python libraries for building AI reasoning agents. You'll also set up secure credential management to protect your API keys and sensitive information. By the end, you'll have a complete toolkit ready for creating sophisticated AI agent systems.\n",

    "**Understanding PraisonAI Agents Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "PraisonAI is a powerful framework specifically designed for creating and managing multiple AI agents that can work together seamlessly. Think of it as the ultimate collaboration platform for AI agents—each agent can have specialized skills, and PraisonAI helps them communicate and coordinate their efforts like a conductor leading a symphony.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes PraisonAI particularly valuable:\n",
    "\n",
    "·       **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple AI agents working on complex tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "·       **Flexible Architecture**: Supports different agent communication patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "·       **Framework Integration**: Works with popular AI frameworks like CrewAI and AutoGen\n",
    "\n",
    "·       **Task Management**: Handles workflow coordination between agents\n",
    "\n",
    "·       **Professional-Grade Tools**: Production-ready components for real applications\n",

    "Before installing new packages, let's confirm your Codespace is ready:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\.   \t**Ensure your Codespace is active**:\n",
    "\n",
    "o   You should see the familiar three-panel interface from the previous chapter\n",
    "\n",
    "o   The terminal should be visible at the bottom of your screen\n",

    "o   If no terminal is visible, click \"**Terminal**\" in the top menu, then \"**New Terminal**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\.   \t**Confirm you're in the correct directory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "o   In the terminal, you should see a prompt that ends with $\n",
    "\n",
    "o   Type pwd and press **Enter** to see your current directory path\n",
    "\n",
    "o   You should be in your project's root directory (typically /workspaces/\\[repository-name\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\.   \t**Test your Python environment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "o   Type python \\--version and press **Enter**\n",
    "\n",
    "o   You should see Python version information (3.11 or higher)\n",
